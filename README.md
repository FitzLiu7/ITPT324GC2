Project Overview
Pisces Enterprises is a company that produces a variety of wholesale products, with the insect production area being the largest production section. The current insect production process relies heavily on manual records, which results in low data processing efficiency, a lack of real-time information, and difficulty in inventory forecasting. These issues can easily lead to production and economic losses. To help the client address these problems, this project will develop a web application. It can be accessed through any modern web browser, providing convenience and flexibility, and allowing managers and employees to interact with the system from different locations and devices.
